# Longest Line of Consecutive One in Matrix

Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the length of the longest line of consecutive one in the matrix.

The line could be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or anti-diagonal.

Constraints:

m == mat.length

n == mat[i].length

1 <= m, n <= 104

1 <= m * n <= 104

mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

Sample Input: 

mat = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]

Output: 3
